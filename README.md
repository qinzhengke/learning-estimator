Learning estimators by examples!

## Build

### System

1. Update your GCC to 8.0+ 

```
sudo apt install gcc-8 g++-8
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-8
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-8
```

2. Update your cmake to 3.14+

The configure of CC and CXX is temporary for cmake. 
Google yourself if you want to change you default compiler for cmake permanently.
